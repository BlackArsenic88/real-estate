Project Level

# Introduction
The purpose of the project is to provide access to healthy, delicious, and fresh foods so people have zero hunger. 

We‚Äôre aiming to eliminate food deserts where there are no healthy food options available. Overly processed foods high in sodium, high fructose corn syrups, saturated and trans fats, and other additives have led to an obesity epidemic. Obesity and visceral fats are directly linked to chronic conditions such as heart disease, strokes, diabetes, cancer, and lower quality of life. 

The software service accomplishes this goal by aligning all activities with our core values: Healthy, Delicious, Fresh, Simple, Sustainable, Seasonal, Contemporary [American], Mediterranean, Inspired, Quality, Mindful, New Cuisines. Foods focus on Aesthetic Designs, Sensory Appeal, Therapeutic Value, and Variety. 

By leveraging software, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and large language models, we are able to complete food classifcation for bid datasets, improve quality, reduce costs, save time, and simplify the process of eating healthy, delicious, and fresh foods.
