Project Blackacre

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning regressor designed to predict **fair market prices** for both **real estate sales** and **rentals**.  
The model leverages historical property data and key real estate attributes (location, size, amenities, etc.) to estimate accurate property valuations.  

This tool is useful for:
- Buyers & sellers seeking fair pricing guidance  
- Landlords & tenants evaluating rental agreements  
- Investors conducting property market analysis  
- Real estate professionals enhancing pricing strategies

## Features
- Predicts **sale** and **rental** values of real estate properties  
- Incorporates multiple factors including:
  - Location (city, state, zip code, latitude, longitude, neighborhood data)  
  - Square footage
  - Lot size  
  - Property age & condition  
  - Amenities & upgrades (e.g., pool, garage, modern appliances)  
  - Nearby schools, universities, and transit access 
- Customizable for different geographic regions  
- Built-in evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) for model performance  
- Extensible to support additional features (e.g., zoning, crime rate, walkability)  

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-regressor.git
   cd real-estate-regressor
2. **Instal dependencies**:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Prepare the dataset**:
Place your property dataset (.csv or .json) inside the data/ folder.
Ensure it contains columns for price, location, and features.

4. **Train the model**:
python train.py --data data/your_dataset.csv

5. **Make predictions**:
python predict.py --input sample_property.json

6. **Evaluate performance**:
python evaluate.py --data data/test_set.csv
