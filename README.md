Project Blackacre

## Introduction 🗝️
This repository contains a machine learning regressor designed to predict **fair market prices** for both **real estate sales** and **rentals**.  
The model leverages historical property data and key real estate attributes (location, size, amenities, etc.) to estimate accurate property valuations.  

This tool is useful for:
- Buyers & sellers seeking fair pricing guidance  
- Landlords & tenants evaluating rental agreements  
- Investors conducting property market analysis  
- Real estate professionals enhancing pricing strategies

## Features ✨
- Predicts **sale** and **rental** values of real estate properties  
- Incorporates multiple factors including:
  - Location (city, state, zip code, latitude, longitude, neighborhood data)  
  - Square footage
  - Lot size  
  - Property age & condition  
  - Amenities & upgrades (e.g., pool, garage, modern appliances)  
  - Nearby schools, universities, places of interest, and distance to transit (airports, trains, ports) 
  - Property taxes, repairs and maintenance, required rates of return 
- Customizable for different geographic regions  
- Built-in evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²) for model performance  
- Extensible to support additional features (e.g., zoning, crime rate, walkability)  

## How to Use Demo Model
1. **Fork the repository**:
   Go to: https://github.com/blackarsenic88/real-estate.git
   In the top-right corner, click "Fork"
2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blackarsenic88/real-estate.git
   cd real-estate-regressor
3. **Instal dependencies**:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Prepare the dataset**:
   Place your property dataset (.csv or .json) inside the data/ folder.
   Ensure it contains columns for "Neighborhood", "Lot Area", "Year Built", "Gr Liv Area"
5. **Turn on Data Pipeline**:
   ```bash
   python real_estate_data_pipeline.py
